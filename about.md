I am **Paolo**, a software engineer attending [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/nimiq/5766466041282560) (GSoC).

**GSoC** is a program promoted by Google in which organizations and students work together on free and open-source coding projects for 3 months. I was selected by [INCF](http://incf.org/) and I'll be working on [NeuroStars](http://neurostars.org/) in the period May 19 - August 18. My mentors are [Roman](https://github.com/brainstorm) and [Satrajit](https://github.com/satra).

**NeuroStars** is a question and answer website born from the need to discuss and share knowledge about neuroscience and neuroinformatics. It originates from [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/), a successful Q&A site for the Bioinformatics world created by [Istvan](https://github.com/ialbert).


NeuroStars is written **Python** using the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the [code](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central) is hosted on GitHub.
